## Installation
### System Requirements
* Operating System: Windows, Linux, OS X
* Core 2 Duo or Athlon X2 at 2.4 GHz or higher
* 4+GB RAM, 2+GB free hard disk space

### Software Requirements
* Java 11 JDK or greater (Openjdk or Oracle)

### Recommended Development Tools
* Git client
* JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA with Scipio ERP Plugin

### Prerequisites
In order to install SCIPIO ERP, the following prerequisites must be installed:
* Java 11 JDK or greater
  * Download and Install
  * Set JAVA_HOME Path (Windows)

### Download
The standard way to get SCIPIO ERP is to checkout the master (main) branch, which
provides you with the latest stable version with important updates:

1. Open your command line and run:
  * git clone https://github.com/jyotiSharma099/scipio-erp.git
  * cd scipio-erp
  * git checkout master

Note it is also possible to checkout specific version tags as well as stable
version series this way (e.g., git checkout 3.0.0), but main branch typically
contains the desirable setup for most demo, server and client usages.

### Installation Process
In order to install on a client system or start on a server, the following steps should be used:

1. Open your command line, go to the extracted folder and run:
  * Linux ./install.sh
  * OS X: ./install.sh
  * Windows: install.bat

2. From the same command line run:
  * Linux ./start.sh
  * OS X: bash ./start.sh
  * Windows: start.bat

3. To access the application visit the SCIPIO ERP Dashboard:
  https://localhost:8443/admin

4. To access the SCIPIO ERP applications from the Dashboard use:
  Username: admin
  Password: scipio

If build failure occurs due to missing Nashorn Javascript engine on JDK 15 or later, first run:
  * Linux ./ant download-ant-js
  * OS X: ./ant download-ant-js
  * Windows: ant.bat download-ant-js

Note: These steps are typically too limited for developers; see section below.

                     **Congratulations, you have installed SCIPIO ERP!**

### Updates
1. Retrieve latest code updates from git:
a. git checkout master
b. git pull

2. Reload visual themes:
a. Restart SCIPIO server
b. Visit entity utility services page:
  https://localhost:8443/admin/control/EntityUtilityServices
c. Click "Visual Theme Resources - Reload All, Now"

### Optional Configuration
  https://www.scipioerp.com/community/developer/installation-configuration/configuration/

### Addons
Community and enterprise SCIPIO ERP addons can be added to your working
copy and updated using the 'git-addons' Bash script in the project root.
It requires a Bash 4-compatible terminal (Linux, Mac, Windows Git Bash, Cygwin).

Instructions can be found at:

  https://www.scipioerp.com/community/end-user/addons/

or for brief help and command list, type:

  ./git-addons help

### Docker
We also provide Docker images if you would like to try out Scipio with minimal effort. 
To create a fully functional SCIPIO ERP instance with some demo data already loaded, 
you can create a container with the following command:

   docker build -t ilscipio/scipio-erp:demo .
   docker run -itd -p 8443:8443 ilscipio/scipio-erp:demo

### Development
For developers, the install/start commands above are typically too limited.
The JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment with Scipio ERP Plugin
(found in the integrated IDEA plugin store) is highly recommended and, for compilation and 
development tasks, the traditional bundled Apache Ant commands may and sometimes should be used instead:

1. Clear local database (Derby), clean out old JARs, build, load demo data to database and start:
  * Linux: ./ant clean-all build load-demo start-debug
  * OS X: ./ant clean-all build load-demo start-debug
  * Windows: ant.bat clean-all build load-demo start-debug

If build failure occurs due to missing Nashorn Javascript engine on JDK 15 or later, first run:
  * Linux: ./ant download-ant-js
  * OS X: ./ant download-ant-js
  * Windows: ant.bat download-ant-js

Commands can be listed using: ant -p (./ant -p)

Commonly used and useful Ant developer commands:
  * clean-all (implies clean-data clean-logs)
  * clean-data (Warning: This deletes local Derby database demo data, but not PostgreSQL/external)
  * clean-logs
  * build
  * rebuild
  * lib-clean-cache-full (in case of maven/ivy issues)
  * lib-update-force (in case of maven/ivy issues)
  * start-debug
  * restart-debug
  * rebuild-debug
  * stop-wait

This is a quick cheat sheet and further information for developers can be found on the website documentation.

#### Automatically Download Jar Sources ####

In order for build, lib-update and lib-update-force commands to automatically download third-party JAR sources 
under component libsrc folders for their corresponding binaries under lib, simply create a file named 
"build.scp.local.properties" under project root that sets "lib.update.sources=true".
* Linux/OS X: echo "lib.update.sources=true" >> build.scp.local.properties

After build/lib-update-force is run, IntelliJ IDEA using the Scipio ERP plugin can be instructed to refer to 
these sources and automatically expand into them using Ctrl+B (a good test is HttpServletRequest):
* Tools -> Scipio ERP -> Reload Resource Directories

See build.properties for other options; build.scp.local.properties and other *.scp.local.properties files are 
ignored for version control by .gitignore.
